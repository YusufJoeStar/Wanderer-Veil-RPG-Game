#  Wanderer’s Veil


**Wanderer’s Veil** is a personal project developed over the span of two months, inspired by my passion for action-RPG systems and gameplay design.  

The foundation of the project was built following the **NightRunStudio** Unity tutorials on YouTube, which provided the core structure and mechanics.  

From there, I expanded and refined the systems enhancing the code, visuals, and overall gameplay logic with the assistance of AI tools such as **Claude AI** and **ChatGPT** to improve the structure and clarity.

This project represents a mix of learning, experimentation, and creativity combining external resources with self-driven development and problem-solving.
