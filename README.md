**RPG-GAME** is a personal project developed over the span of two months, inspired by my passion for action-RPG systems and gameplay design.  
The foundation of the project was built following the **NightRun Studio** Unity tutorials on YouTube, which provided the core structure and mechanics.  
From there, I expanded and refined the systems — enhancing the code, visuals, and overall gameplay logic — with the assistance of modern AI tools such as **Claude AI** and **ChatGPT** to improve efficiency, structure, and clarity.

This project represents a mix of learning, experimentation, and creativity — combining external resources with self-driven development and problem-solving.
