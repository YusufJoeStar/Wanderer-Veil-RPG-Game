**Wanderer Viel** is a personal project developed over the span of one month, inspired by my passion for action-RPG systems and gameplay design.  

The foundation of the project was built following the **NightRunStudio** Unity tutorials on YouTube, which provided the core structure and mechanics.  

From there, I expanded and refined the systems enhancing the code, visuals, and overall gameplay logic with the assistance of AI tools such as **Claude AI** and **ChatGPT** to improve the structure and clarity.

This project represents a mix of learning, experimentation, and creativity combining external resources with self-driven development and problem-solving.

##  Glitches & Known Issues

- [ ] **Archer Form Animation Bug**:

   When switching to the Archer form, the walking animation does not play correctly. As a result, the player may appear frozen during movement, despite actual motion input being registered.
   [FIXED]



- [ ] **Arrow Shooting Responsiveness**:

   The bow and arrow mechanics currently lack smoothness. The firing sequence and animation timing require optimization to achieve more fluid and responsive combat feedback.
   [FIXED]


  
- [ ] **Enemy Tracking Behavior**:

   The enemy AI tracking system can become sluggish or unresponsive when the player moves behind collidable objects. In these cases, enemies may freeze or fail to reacquire the player target correctly.


  
- [ ] **NPC Portrait Alignment**:

   In-game NPC dialogue portraits are not properly scaled or aligned within the portrait UI frame, resulting in cropped or misaligned character visuals.
